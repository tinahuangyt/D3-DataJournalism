## U.S. Census Data Visualization with D3
This project uses D3.js to visualize the [2014 Y.S ACS Census Data](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml).  

Scatterplot exploring the relationship between poverty rate and lack of health care in each of state is created. Data of the poverty rate and % population without healthcare will be display upon mouse hover on the relevant scatter.

`python -m http.server` is needed to run the visualization.
